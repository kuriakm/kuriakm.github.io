                <h3>About the Writer</h3>
                <p> Marshall is currently a rising senior at the University of South Carolina.</p>
                <p>Marshall began his college career as an Illustration major due to his strong love of art, but chose
                    to pursue a degree in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Cybersecurity due to
                    burnout. However, his interest in art has allowed him a unique perspective on the video games he
                    plays, creating the foundation of Pixel Renaissance.</p>
                <p>He has been playing video games since he was a little kid and hasn't stopped since. The first
                    game he played was Brave Fencer Musashi on the PS1, which cemented his interest in video games
                    and the themes/motifs they entail.</p>
                <p> Marshall lives with his two cats, Makku and Chinnu, and enjoys drawing and coding in his free time.
