                <h2>Buckshot Roulette: The Devastating Reality of Gambling Addiction</h2>
                <h4>May 22nd, 2024</h4>
                <p> Despite the simplicity of the game, <em>Buckshot Roulette</em> (2024) paints a story about the
                    harrowing
                    reality of gambling addiction and the lengths people will go to satiate their addiction.

                            <p> The protagonist was doomed the moment you started the game.</p>
                            <p> From the adrenaline-pumping music to the intensity of the amped-up Russian roulette
                                you play with the dealer, it is easy to miss the tragedy that is taking place here:
                                regardless of whether you "win" or "lose", the protagonist has already fallen too deep
                                into a gambling addiction that they cannot recover from.</p>
                            <p> Before the game has officially started, the main menu highlights the premise (and the
                                inevitable temptation) of the game through the buckshots raining down on screen. This
                                design choice creates a underlying agreement between you and the game that the actions
                                you take for the character you are playing as may cost them their life.</p>

                            <p> We begin the actual game with the protagonist in a bathroom with loud (but muffled)
                                club music playing outside and the letters "AFRAID" written on the mirror. This is a
                                crucial but often overlooked detail in the game. In other media such as movies and TV
                                shows, club bathrooms are often used as areas where characters can let go and express
                                themselves fully outside of the suffocating environments they were initial in.</p>

                <h3>About the Writer</h3>
                <p> Marshall is currently a rising senior at the University of South Carolina.</p>
                <p>Marshall began his college career as an Illustration major due to his strong love of art, but
                    chose
                    to pursue a degree in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Cybersecurity due to
                    burnout. However, his interest in art has allowed him a unique perspective on the video games he
                    plays, creating the foundation of Pixel Renaissance.</p>
                <p>He has been playing video games since he was a little kid and hasn't stopped since. The first
                    game he played was Brave Fencer Musashi on the PS1, which cemented his interest in video
                    games
                    and the themes/motifs they entail.</p>
                <p> Marshall lives with his two cats, Makku and Chinnu, and enjoys drawing and coding in his free
                    time.
