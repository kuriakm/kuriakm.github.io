                <h2>About Pixel Renaissance</h2>
                <p>Pixel Renaissance was born out of three passions of mine: art, video games, and sociocultural
                    analysis. I have always wanted a place where I could expound on my thoughts regarding the video
                    games I played, especially when it came to the larger themes presented in them as well as how the
                    art style influenced the overall playing experience.
                </p>
                <p>We also have a store page if you are interested in supporting our mission of providing thoughtful
                    commentary and challenging preexisting notions about the video games you love.</p>
                </p>
                <p>We are happy to have you here and hope that you will find a greater artistic and sociocultural
                    appreciation for the media you choose to enjoy.</p>

                <h3>About the Writer</h3>
                <p> Marshall is currently a rising senior at the University of South Carolina.</p>
                <p>Marshall began his college career as an Illustration major due to his strong love of art, but chose
                    to pursue a degree in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Cybersecurity due to
                    burnout. However, his interest in art has allowed him a unique perspective on the video games he
                    plays, creating the foundation of Pixel Renaissance.</p>
                <p>He has been playing video games since he was a little kid and hasn't stopped since. The first
                    game he played was Musashi: Samurai Legend on the PS1, which cemented his interest in video games
                    and the themes/motifs they entail.</p>
                <p> Marshall lives with his two cats, Makku and Chinnu, and enjoys drawing and coding in his free time.
