    <h1>A Short Introduction to Cats</h1>
    <h2>Brief History</h1>
        <p>Cats, which are commonly referred to domestic cats or house cats, are small domesticated mammals. They are
            the only species in the Felidae family to be domesticated. The most common type of cat are domestic
            shorthairs, which have been around since 2000 BCE. The oldest domesticated cat breed is the Egyptian Mau;
            they are a spotted shorthair cat with around 3,000 existing worldwide. The earliest known interaction
            between humans and cats most likely happened during the early days of agriculture. Since humans needed their
            grain to be safe from rodents and cats needed a steady food source, a symbiotic relationship was created
            between the two and cats quickly became an integral part of human life.</p>

        <h2>General Nature</h2>
        <p>Domestic cats are near identical to their wild counterparts. Their facial features have barely regressed
            compared to dogs and they have kept their aloof demeanor and independent nature. These characteristics have
            allowed cats to thrive as predators, which is why feral cats are able to survive in the wild. Cats
            communicate through their tail movement, vocalization, use of eye contact, and resting positions.
            Happy cats usually have upright or gently curved tails; vocalize through purring, chirping, and/or trilling
            (meowing and purring at the same time); blink slowly when making eye contact; and rest on their backs or in
            a comfortable (and often vulnerable) position.</p>
